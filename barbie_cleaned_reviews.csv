"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",6,Margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me It was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies It started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused And before you say Im a crotchety old man Im a woman in my 20s so Im pretty sure Im this movies target audience The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie Overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,Margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me It was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies It started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused And before you say Im a crotchety old man Im a woman in my s so Im pretty sure Im this movies target audience The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie Overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me it was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies it started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused and before you say im a crotchety old man im a woman in my s so im pretty sure im this movies target audience the saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homages movies started way ended overdramatized speeches ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movies target audience saddest part parents kids theater victims poor marketing kids movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept falls apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman,margot best she given film disappoint market fun quirki satir homag movi start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus say im crotcheti old man im woman im pretti sure im movi target audienc saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman,margot best she given film disappoint market fun quirki satir homag movi start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus say im crotcheti old man im woman im pretti sure im movi target audienc saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman,margot best she given film disappoint market fun quirki satir homag movi start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus say im crotcheti old man im woman im pretti sure im movi target audienc saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman
A Hot Pink Mess,"Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.",6,Before making Barbie 2023 Greta Gerwig singlehandedly directed two films Lady Bird 2017 and Little Women

"As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that's ok.","As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10

Too heavy handed,"As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are ""brainwashed"" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.",6,As a woman that grew up with

Well this really did come as a surprise.,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.",8,It pains me to say it but I enjoyed this

3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.,"The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised.

It was depressing,"I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men.

My mom and I saw this yesterday. Here are my thoughts.,"I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.",6,I dont know if I put spoilers in here I am super worn out Haha So I will just put that I didI had no clue what this movie was like or about It just seemed like a strange

The marketing was more entertaining than the actual movie,"I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term ""Marvel speak."" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: ""You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!""The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.",4,I went to see this today everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastelcolored camp for two hours BARBIE

"Brilliant observations, but social depth is missing","Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.",6,Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life whether funny or deeply interpersonal into a screenplay

Somewhat of a Jumbled Mess,"My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.",5,My 15year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB accountAs a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie I was expecting

lifesized The movie was also very funny at parts I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction,my year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my imdb accountas a barbie fan i was very excited for this movie i was expecting a lighthearted goofy comedy instead i got a movie that felt as though it didnt know where it was going or what it was doingthe movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy then things start changingthings start going wrong for barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it she is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in barbie land this on its own wouldve been enough for a movie but it keeps goinginstead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for barbie the movie goes off in a totally different directionken sees the real worlds patriarchy and goes back to barbie land to replicate it barbie has to go back to barbie land to save it from its new patriarchyby the end of the movie barbie decides to live in the real world the kens of the barbie land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising i find the treatment of the kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movies supposed messaging about equalitythis movies writing and plot were bad even as a feminist i acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy i feel as though

Fun and surprisingly touching,"I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.",8,I was honestly doubting this movie at first but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lotSet in the colorful Barbie Land stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day One day she shows signs of beinga human She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect againBarbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer The set designs are eyecatching and on point as well Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts but it is Gosling who mostly shinesSomething Im pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars most likely for Best Production Design Best Costume Design and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish That song is beautiful and its stuck in my head right now,I was honestly doubting this movie at first but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lotSet in the colorful Barbie Land stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day One day she shows signs of beinga human She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect againBarbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer The set designs are eyecatching and on point as well Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts but it is Gosling who mostly shinesSomething Im pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars most likely for Best Production Design Best Costume Design and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish That song is beautiful and its stuck in my head right now,i was honestly doubting this movie at first but surprisingly i find myself really liking it quite a lotset in the colorful barbie land stereotypical barbie lives a perfect life every single day one day she shows signs of beinga human she decides to go to the real world to find the cure in order to make herself perfect againbarbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer the set designs are eyecatching and on point as well both margot robbie and ryan gosling nailed their parts but it is gosling who mostly shinessomething im pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the oscars most likely for best production design best costume design and probably best song for billie eilish that song is beautiful and its stuck in my head right now,honestly doubting movie first surprisingly find really liking quite lotset colorful barbie land stereotypical barbie lives perfect life every single day one day shows signs beinga human decides go real world find cure order make perfect againbarbie fun movie surprisingly plenty heartwarming moments good messages offer set designs eyecatching point well margot robbie ryan gosling nailed parts gosling mostly shinessomething im pretty sure movie getting nominated oscars likely best production design best costume design probably best song billie eilish song beautiful stuck head right,honestli doubt movi first surprisingli find realli like quit lotset color barbi land stereotyp barbi live perfect life everi singl day one day show sign beinga human decid go real world find cure order make perfect againbarbi fun movi surprisingli plenti heartwarm moment good messag offer set design eyecatch point well margot robbi ryan gosl nail part gosl mostli shinessometh im pretti sure movi get nomin oscar like best product design best costum design probabl best song billi eilish song beauti stuck head right,honestli doubt movi first surprisingli find realli like quit lotset color barbi land stereotyp barbi live perfect life everi singl day one day show sign beinga human decid go real world find cure order make perfect againbarbi fun movi surprisingli plenti heartwarm moment good messag offer set design eyecatch point well margot robbi ryan gosl nail part gosl mostli shinessometh im pretti sure movi get nomin oscar like best product design best costum design probabl best song billi eilish song beauti stuck head right,honestli doubt movi first surprisingli find realli like quit lotset color barbi land stereotyp barbi live perfect life everi singl day one day show sign beinga human decid go real world find cure order make perfect againbarbi fun movi surprisingli plenti heartwarm moment good messag offer set design eyecatch point well margot robbi ryan gosl nail part gosl mostli shinessometh im pretti sure movi get nomin oscar like best product design best costum design probabl best song billi eilish song beauti stuck head right
Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,I walked out of the theatre thinking Yeah I had a good time in that movie But as the day went on I kind had

A Technicolor Dream,"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets.

The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with.

Didn't live up to expectations,"I watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes, but I talked her into watching it - ""It'll get better, honey. They'll be going into the real world, soon.""Well, it didn't get better, after they went into the real world.

You are Kenough,"This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon.

OVERHYPED,"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down.

Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent Gosling is specially hilarious I expected a funny cool deep and entertaining movie but I was highly disappointed The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment We the audience have brains so please preach somewhere else Furthermore this is a movie to divide not to unite And Im a woman The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad There are some great actresses that have too little to say like Emma Mackey and thats a pity Overall a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity 310 1 point for Margot Robbie 1 point for Ryan Gosling and 1 point for the art direction super tacky and pinky as Barbies world,Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent Gosling is specially hilarious I expected a funny cool deep and entertaining movie but I was highly disappointed The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment We the audience have brains so please preach somewhere else Furthermore this is a movie to divide not to unite And Im a woman The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad There are some great actresses that have too little to say like Emma Mackey and thats a pity Overall a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity   point for Margot Robbie  point for Ryan Gosling and  point for the art direction super tacky and pinky as Barbies world,margot robbie and ryan gosling are really great in their roles of barbie and kent gosling is specially hilarious i expected a funny cool deep and entertaining movie but i was highly disappointed the movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment we the audience have brains so please preach somewhere else furthermore this is a movie to divide not to unite and im a woman the script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad there are some great actresses that have too little to say like emma mackey and thats a pity overall a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity   point for margot robbie  point for ryan gosling and  point for the art direction super tacky and pinky as barbies world,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain plea preach somewher el furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain plea preach somewher el furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world
Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

I would have preferred to see this as a 30 minute TV sitcom,"Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various Ken's we agreed that Ryan Gosling appeared to be the main character and not Barbie.Don't get me wrong, both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of Ken and Barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the Ryan Gosling ""Ken doll"" with an enhanced CGI eight (8) pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for Ryan Gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through Barbie's vision of the changing world.The visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the 1960's Elvis films such as Blue Hawaii since Barbie and Elvis were popular icons within the same era. The downside of the Barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male Ken dolls.All in all it was a decent film, not to be considered a future film classic, nor a memorable Ryan Goslng or Margot Robbie performance worthy of an Academy Award but just like Barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era.

Not what I Expected,"I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it.

However, things soon became negative about 20 - 25 minutes into the movie. I couldn't stand it. Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the ""conflict"" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn't need to go that way, that far, that fast. I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs. This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict.",No Rating,I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of the movie It was very upbeat positive and light However things soon became negative about 20  25 minutes into the movie I couldnt stand it Barbies world and attitude was a constant bummer Kens attitude was sour For the next hour and more the movie just lived in negativityI bought tickets to this show a month ago And I saw it the day before the official opening day I was very excited about this movie And I was playing the music Dua Lipa song almost every day I was really excited for this movie  and was looking forward to something very positive But the vast majority of the movie was the conflict part of the writing It was just too much The movie didnt need to go that way that far that fast I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict,I really enjoyed the first  minutes of the movie It was very upbeat positive and light However things soon became negative about    minutes into the movie I couldnt stand it Barbies world and attitude was a constant bummer Kens attitude was sour For the next hour and more the movie just lived in negativityI bought tickets to this show a month ago And I saw it the day before the official opening day I was very excited about this movie And I was playing the music Dua Lipa song almost every day I was really excited for this movie  and was looking forward to something very positive But the vast majority of the movie was the conflict part of the writing It was just too much The movie didnt need to go that way that far that fast I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict,i really enjoyed the first  minutes of the movie it was very upbeat positive and light however things soon became negative about    minutes into the movie i couldnt stand it barbies world and attitude was a constant bummer kens attitude was sour for the next hour and more the movie just lived in negativityi bought tickets to this show a month ago and i saw it the day before the official opening day i was very excited about this movie and i was playing the music dua lipa song almost every day i was really excited for this movie  and was looking forward to something very positive but the vast majority of the movie was the conflict part of the writing it was just too much the movie didnt need to go that way that far that fast i would have preferred a more shallow and fun barbie movie vs this barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict,really enjoyed first minutes movie upbeat positive light however things soon became negative minutes movie couldnt stand barbies world attitude constant bummer kens attitude sour next hour movie lived negativityi bought tickets show month ago saw day official opening day excited movie playing music dua lipa song almost every day really excited movie looking forward something positive vast majority movie conflict part writing much movie didnt need go way far fast would preferred shallow fun barbie movie vs barbie movie filled hour conflict,realli enjoy first minut movi upbeat posit light howev thing soon becam neg minut movi couldnt stand barbi world attitud constant bummer ken attitud sour next hour movi live negativityi bought ticket show month ago saw day offici open day excit movi play music dua lipa song almost everi day realli excit movi look forward someth posit vast major movi conflict part write much movi didnt need go way far fast would prefer shallow fun barbi movi vs barbi movi fill hour conflict,realli enjoy first minut movi upbeat posit light howev thing soon becam neg minut movi couldnt stand barbi world attitud constant bummer ken attitud sour next hour movi live negativityi bought ticket show month ago saw day offici open day excit movi play music dua lipa song almost everi day realli excit movi look forward someth posit vast major movi conflict part write much movi didnt need go way far fast would prefer shallow fun barbi movi v barbi movi fill hour conflict,realli enjoy first minut movi upbeat posit light howev thing soon becam neg minut movi couldnt stand barbi world attitud constant bummer ken attitud sour next hour movi live negativityi bought ticket show month ago saw day offici open day excit movi play music dua lipa song almost everi day realli excit movi look forward someth posit vast major movi conflict part write much movi didnt need go way far fast would prefer shallow fun barbi movi v barbi movi fill hour conflict
