I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\",\n          \"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.\",\n          \"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \\\"strong\\\" woman.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"9\",\n          \"10\",\n          \"5\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\",\n          \"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.\",\n          \"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \\\"strong\\\" woman.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"9\",\n          \"10\",\n          \"5\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"noise_removed\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"I dont know if I put spoilers in here I am super worn out Haha So I will just put that I didI had no clue what this movie was like or about It just seemed like a strange different type of movie To me it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect It was nothing like thatThere were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me I felt weird knowing that There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see thisThe movie is really all focused on political and gender views So that one totally surprised meThere are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes A bit of the singing kind of went on There were also times that I was all tearyThere are sexual references in this Young kids would not understand But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have and a specific thing Ken does not have that was a bit strangeThe end threw me off Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal but we are not treated that way Yet at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots Also something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were But unlike the way things seem to be in Barbie land the women will be above all men I didnt really get that Then what may be the last lines of the movie place Barbie somewhere I didnt get the point of itI heard adults laughing repeatedly The kids that were their kind of sat silentThis is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater Also I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world It was just cool to see\",\n          \"Wow this movie was a love letter to cinema From the Kubrick reference at the opening to the soundstage being 100 real  no cgi for the sets There were dance sequences like in the olden days think Grease and the costuming  wow the costuming Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way The casting director also nailed it everyone was wonderfulThe acting was perfection I loved seeing the variety of Barbies on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasnt swearing or nudity There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but thats not really violence compared to todays average films no one was harmed nor any fake blood usedI actually didnt like the ending at all and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion  something Ruth Handler never dealt with Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter  hows that so tough to explainIrregardless I want to see this movie again And again And again\",\n          \"Margot does the best with what shes given but this film was very disappointing to me It was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies It started that way but ended with overdramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused And before you say Im a crotchety old man Im a woman in my 20s so Im pretty sure Im this movies target audience The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie Overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand.

To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again.

The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with.

To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again.

The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with.

I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again.

The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with.

There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off.

I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again.

I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\",\n          \"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.\",\n          \"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \\\"strong\\\" woman.\"\n

I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.\",\n          \"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again.

And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.
